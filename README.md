# TestIt

---------------------------------

This is a plugin for SpoutPlugin/SpoutCraft enabled servers to easily and swiftly manipulate and test different API features, without constant restarts. Developers may find this useful to try and find the effects they are looking for, without the hassle of tweaking and re-compiling over and over again.

## Features

* Test the Sound Effect API with the Sound Emitter Block.
* Test the Particle API with the Particle Emitter Block.
* Choose sounds on the fly.
* Manipulate all aspects of a particle and spawn the particles at will.
* GUIs to make things easy.
* Punch the emitters to activate.
* Use the GUI to activate emitters (punching will destroy it in creative mode)
* Use Redstone to activate the emitters (again, useful in creative mode).

## Usage

You will find that some particles don't respond to some settings. These are not bugs, but more like limitations. This utility will help you understand what you can and can not do with the particle API.

Grab an emitter out of the creative menu.
Place It -> Right Click It (for gui) -> Punch It (or redstone it)

Easy.
